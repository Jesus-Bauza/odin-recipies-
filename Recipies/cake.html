      This homemade chocolate cake recipe is super easy to prepare in one bowl
      for a deliciously moist and fluffy chocolate cake. This is the best
      chocolate cake I have ever had! Frost with your favorite frosting.

    <h2><strong>How to Store Chocolate Cake </strong></h2>
    <p>
      The best way to store this one-bowl chocolate cake depends on the frosting
      you choose. A buttercream-frosted cake can sit (covered) at room
      temperature for up to five days. If you use cream cheese frosting, though,
      you'll want to refrigerate it within two hours.

    <h2>Can You Freeze Chocolate Cake?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes! You can absolutely freeze this chocolate cake. We recommend freezing
      the individual, unfrosted layers. Just wrap the (completely cooled) layers
      tightly in storage wrap. Follow that with a layer of aluminum foil labeled
      with the date. For the best protection, store the double-wrapped cake
      layers in an airtight container. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in
      the fridge overnight.

      "I make this cake all the time and my family loves it," says Kali Hintz.
      "They request it any time they get the chance to. Also, on top of that it
      is so easy to prepare and cook! The recipe is delicious, the cake is rich
      in flavor and also very moist. My number one choice of cake so far." "This
      is my new go to chocolate cake," raves another reviewer. "I substituted
      dark cocoa and used espresso instead of water. I baked it in a Bundt pan
      and finished it with a light dusting of confectioner's sugar. This is the
      best recipe I've come across!" "This was fantastic," according to Hannah
      Culbertson. "I, like many other people, was a little scared after adding
      the water. But the cake was great! I actually made cupcakes, and it made
      24 overflowing cupcakes. They tasted so good. Rich and fluffy all at the
      same time."

        <li>
          Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees

          minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
